\indent  This lab report includes a basic introduction of the process of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks and defense to the lab students. This lab consisted of three main parts completed over several weeks. The goal for the first week was for the lab group to create a web server and defend it. The web server must be built using Python and run on the Raspberry Pi. The second week of the lab consisted of writing a DDoS attack script using Python. This script will target other groups servers in an attempt to take them down. The final piece of the lab requires the completion of the first two parts. During lab class all groups will attack the student's server. In addition, each group will attack each other individually. These attacks will be timed and it will be recorded which servers crash and which withstand the attacks. Overall this lab will introduce students to writing DDoS attack and defense python scripts.

% Introduction
\section{Introduction}
A DOS (Denial of Service) attack is used to deny intended users access to a specific server or website. Through flooding the server's resources, or breaking the server's inner mechanics, the server is brought offline, thus giving users an error code or denying any access to the website itself.
\indent Symptoms that a service is currently experiencing, or has experienced, a DOS attack include: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Slow access to website / file access or transfer
    \item Inability to access a website
    \item Disconnection of wired or wireless connection
\end{itemize} \\

Several web services that give anyone the ability to DOS anything are currently available online. As well as countless amounts of DOS programs and code that others have uploaded on the internet for anyone to use. Most of these systems use a single, or a handful of attacking methods to ruin the accessibility of the designated webserver. The most common example of a flood could be the ICMP Flood. This attack sends millions of modified packets to the targeted IP address or webserver to use up it's resources and put if offline. \\
\indent If the target is a larger service or server then the attacker might want to make use of a botnet or a distributed attack to take down the service. A distributed attack takes the resources from multiple computers to run the attack on the targeted webserver. Theoretically, with enough power from a multitude of computers, an attacker could take down even the largest of websites and services. \\
\indent Another popular method of flooding a server is a Synchronous Flood Attack. A webserver usually communicates with requests from a computer by sending an Acknowledgement after that computer sends the server a SYN. The way a SYN flood works is that the program will open several SYN/ACK connections that are only half completed, i.e the webserver doesn't get the chance to send the program an acknowledgement back. As the amount of half connections increases, the webserver will slow to a halt. \\
\indent Services such as CloudFlare help website owners to protect against DOS attacks at a very successful rate. However, there are standalone techniques to protect against DOS attacks. An effective method is to redirect the IP address that is found to be sending, or requesting, a massive amount of damage to the server. This can easily be bypassed through IP spoofing however. Other cloaks can be used to monitor the incoming traffic before giving the user access to the website. If this user is found suspicious then the server will deny entry through a filtering service.

%Methods
\section{Methods and Procedures}
This lab resulted in the creation of three python scripts. One created a web server, one pinged a server to see if it was up or down, and one attacks other groups servers. All python scripts must begin with \textit{\#!/bin/python}. The next few lines will contain any libraries that need to be imported. Then the main program will begin.

\subsection{Creating a Webserver}

\subsection{Pinging a Server}
Pinging a server is an important ability for an attacker and a server owner. The owner will want to make sure that their server has not been taken down by an attack while the attacker will want to know when their target server has fallen. The students created a python script which printed to the user every two seconds if the server they selected is up or down. The script begins with five imports: os, time, socket, urllib2, and sys. Each of these allows the programmer to use special commands within the language. The program takes two inputs; the first is the ip address of the target and the second is the port of the target. The script is made of the function internet\_on. The program will continue to run through this function until it is manually stopped or the program times out. As shown in the figure below the program uses a try, except statement. The function will try to open the server at the port and if it can it will print that the port is up. If it cannot connect then it will print that the server is done. The code: \textit{time.sleep(2)} pauses the program for two seconds before running again.

\subsection{Creating a DDoS Attack}

\subsection{Battle Royale}
During lab class of the third week of working on the lab each groups server will be tested to show the capabilities of their attack and defense. To test their defense all other groups will attack the server at once. The attack will last for a time specified by the TA. If the server is still running after this time then the group will have proven their defense works. To test the attack capabilities of the group, they will attack all the other groups once at a time and tally how many groups they are able to crash.  he attack will last for a time specified by the TA. If the server is not running after this time has expired then the group will have proven their attack works.

% Laboratory experimental results
\section{Laboratory Experimental Results}
This entire lab revolved around the use of the programming language, Python. Defending a web server from a DDoS attack is extremely important in computer security as to websites from being crashed from unwanted predators. The exact web server used can be seen in figure 1 in the appendix. This is the same that was explained in the methods section. In addition, the exact DDoS attack used can be seen in figure 2 in the appendix. Again, it is the same as explained in the methods. By using a Smurf attack students are able to send large amounts of internet control message protocol (ICMP) ping traffic to the target server. The reply address is spoofed to the intended victim. Due to the fact that a single internet broadcast address can support a maximum of 255 hosts a smurf attack amplifies a single ping 255 times. This results in the network being slowed down to a point where it is impossible to use. 	
\newline \tab 
Through full completion of this lab, the students have gained a great amount of experience working within python to create DDoS defensive and offensive scripts as well as becoming acquainted with using their Raspberry Pis to connect to other groups.

% Discussion
\section{Discussion}
\section{Discussion}
Every piece of this lab required students to write a python script. The students found themselves looking up a myriad of commands within the language as well as a plethora of libraries such as os, time, socket, urllib2, and sys. This lab requires a lot of research online as well as a lot of trial and error. Due to this it is very helpful to seek help from another group, the TA, or even the professor.

% Laboratory reflection
\section{Laboratory reflection}
I, Julia Sorrentino, found this lab difficult to complete. I spent a great deal of time trying to teach myself how to create a DDoS attack and defense via YouTube videos and other online sources listed in the reference section. I spent hours taking notes, however found very few examples online to use as a basis for creating our scripts. Overall, I found this lab to be very time consuming, but opposed to previous labs, the more time I put into it I still did not understand what I was doing.
