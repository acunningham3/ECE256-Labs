\indent  This lab report includes a basic introduction of the process of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks and defense to the lab students. This lab consisted of three main parts completed over several weeks. The goal for the first week was for the lab group to create a web server and defend it. The web server must be built using Python and run on the Raspberry Pi. The second week of the lab consisted of writing a DDoS attack script using Python. This script will target other groups servers in an attempt to take them down. The final piece of the lab requires the completion of the first two parts. During lab class all groups will attack the student's server. In addition, each group will attack each other individually. These attacks will be timed and it will be recorded which servers crash and which withstand the attacks. Overall this lab will introduce students to writing DDoS attack and defense python scripts.

\section{Laboratory Experimental Results}
This entire lab revolved around the use of the programming language, Python. Defending a web server from a DDoS attack is extremely important in computer security as to websites from being crashed from unwanted predators. The exact web server used can be seen in figure 1 in the appendix. This is the same that was explained in the methods section. In addition, the exact DDoS attack used can be seen in figure 2 in the appendix. Again, it is the same as explained in the methods. By using a Smurf attack students are able to send large amounts of internet control message protocol (ICMP) ping traffic to the target server. The reply address is spoofed to the intended victim. Due to the fact that a single internet broadcast address can support a maximum of 255 hosts a smurf attack amplifies a single ping 255 times. This results in the network being slowed down to a point where it is impossible to use. 	
\newline \tab 
Through full completion of this lab, the students have gained a great amount of experience working within python to create DDoS defensive and offensive scripts as well as becoming acquainted with using their Raspberry Pis to connect to other groups.

% Laboratory reflection
\section{Laboratory reflection}
I, Julia Sorrentino, found this lab difficult to complete. I spent a great deal of time trying to teach myself how to create a DDoS attack and defense via YouTube videos and other online sources listed in the reference section. I spent hours taking notes, however found very few examples online to use as a basis for creating our scripts. Overall, I found this lab to be very time consuming, but opposed to previous labs, the more time I put into it I still did not understand what I was doing.
